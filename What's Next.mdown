# What's Next ?

## Optimizations

* Uses gcd when possible for the dropbox pulling/updates
         -> Calls to DBRestClient MUST be done on the main thread but part of the job could be done in background.
         
* Uses delta updates from dropbox instead of pulling everything
         -> If permissions change, we'll have to pull everything to know wich files we should remove from the cache directory.
